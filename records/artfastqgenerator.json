 "description": "outputs artificial FASTQ files derived from a reference genome\n ArtificialFastqGenerator takes the reference genome (in FASTA format) as\n input and outputs artificial FASTQ files in the Sanger format. It can\n accept Phred base quality scores from existing FASTQ files, and use them\n to simulate sequencing errors. Since the artificial FASTQs are derived\n from the reference genome, the reference genome provides a gold-standard\n for calling variants (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and\n insertions and deletions (indels)). This enables evaluation of a Next\n Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis pipeline which aligns reads to the\n reference genome and then calls the variants."

 "description": "Trie-based DNA sequencing read demultiplexer\n Axe very rapidly selects the optimal barcode present in a sequence read, even\n in the presence of sequencing errors. The algorithm is able to handle\n combinatorial barcoding, barcodes of differing length, and several mismatches\n per barcode."

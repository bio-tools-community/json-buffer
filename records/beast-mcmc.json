 "description": "Bayesian MCMC phylogenetic inference\n BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular \n sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured \n phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It\n can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a \n framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a \n single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that \n each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. Included \n is a simple to use user-interface program for setting up standard \n analyses and a suit of programs for analysing the results."

 "description": "mapping single-molecule sequencing reads\n Basic local alignment with successive refinement (BLASR) is a method\n for mapping single-molecule sequencing reads against a reference genome.\n Such reads are thousands of bases long, with divergence between them\n and the genome being dominated by insertion and deletion error."

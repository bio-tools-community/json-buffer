 "description": "BLAST Ring Image Generator\n BRIG can display circular comparisons between a large number of genomes,\n with a focus on handling genome assembly data.\n  * Images show similarity between a central reference sequence and other\n    sequences as concentric rings.\n  * BRIG will perform all BLAST comparisons and file parsing automatically\n    via a simple GUI.\n  * Contig boundaries and read coverage can be displayed for draft genomes;\n    customized graphs and annotations can be displayed.\n  * Using a user-defined set of genes as input, BRIG can display gene\n    presence, absence, truncation or sequence variation in a set of\n    complete genomes, draft genomes or even raw, unassembled sequence data.\n  * BRIG also accepts SAM-formatted read-mapping files enabling genomic\n    regions present in unassembled sequence data from multiple samples to\n    be compared simultaneously"

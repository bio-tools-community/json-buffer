 "description": "single molecule sequence assembler for genomes\n Canu is a fork of the Celera Assembler, designed for high-noise\n single-molecule sequencing (such as the PacBio RS II or Oxford\n Nanopore MinION).\n .\n Canu is a hierarchical assembly pipeline which runs in four steps:\n .\n  * Detect overlaps in high-noise sequences using MHAP\n  * Generate corrected sequence consensus\n  * Trim corrected sequences\n  * Assemble trimmed corrected sequences"

 "description": "suite of programs designed to quickly group sequences\n cd-hit contains a number of programs designed to quickly group\n sequences. cd-hit groups proteins into clusters that meet a user-defined\n similarity threshold. cd-hit-est is similar to cd-hit, but designed to\n group nucleotide sequences (without introns). cd-hit-est-2d is similar\n to cd-hit-2d but designed to compare two nucleotide datasets. A number\n of other related programs are also in this package. Please see the\n cd-hit user manual, also part of this package, for further information. "

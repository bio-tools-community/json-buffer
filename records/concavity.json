 "description": "predictor of protein ligand binding sites from structure and conservation\n ConCavity predicts protein ligand binding sites by combining evolutionary\n sequence conservation and 3D structure.\n .\n ConCavity takes as input a PDB format protein structure and optionally\n files that characterize the evolutionary sequence conservation of the chains\n in the structure file.\n .\n The following result files are produced by default:\n  * Residue ligand binding predictions for each chain (*.scores).\n  * Residue ligand binding predictions in a PDB format file (residue\n    scores placed in the temp. factor field, *_residue.pdb).\n  * Pocket prediction locations in a DX format file (*.dx).\n  * PyMOL script to visualize the predictions (*.pml)."

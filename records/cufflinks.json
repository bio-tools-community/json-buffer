 "description": "Transcript assembly, differential expression and regulation for RNA-Seq\n Cufflinks assembles transcripts, estimates their abundances, and tests for\n differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq samples. It accepts aligned\n RNA-Seq reads and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of\n transcripts. Cufflinks then estimates the relative abundances of these\n transcripts based on how many reads support each one."

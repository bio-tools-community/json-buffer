 "description": "local alignment discovery between long nucleotide sequencing reads\n These tools permit one to find all significant local alignments between\n reads encoded in a Dazzler database. The assumption is that the reads are\n from a Pacific Biosciences RS II long read sequencer. That is, the reads\n are long and noisy, up to 15% on average."

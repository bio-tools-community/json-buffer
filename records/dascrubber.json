 "description": "alignment-based scrubbing pipeline for DNA sequencing reads\n The Dazzler Scrubbing Suite produces a set of edited reads that are guaranteed\n to\n  * be continuous stretches of the underlying genome (i.e. no unremoved\n    adapters and not chimers)\n  * have no very low quality stretches (i.e. the error rate never exceeds some\n    reasonable maximum, 20% or so in the case of Pacbio data).\n Its secondary goal is to do so with the minimum removal of data and splitting\n of reads."

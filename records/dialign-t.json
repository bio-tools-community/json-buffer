 "description": "Segment-based multiple sequence alignment\n DIALIGN-TX is a command line tool to perform multiple alignment of protein or\n DNA sequences. It is a complete reimplementation of the segment-base approach\n including several new improvements and heuristics that significantly enhance\n the quality of the output alignments compared to DIALIGN 2.2 and DIALIGN-T.\n For pairwise alignment, DIALIGN-TX uses a fragment-chaining algorithm that\n favours chains of low-scoring local alignments over isolated high-scoring\n fragments. For multiple alignment, DIALIGN-TX uses an improved greedy\n procedure that is less sensitive to spurious local sequence similarities."

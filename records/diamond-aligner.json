 "description": "accelerated BLAST compatible local sequence aligner\n DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches\n and functions as a drop-in replacement for the NCBI BLAST software\n tools. It is suitable for protein-protein search as well as DNA-protein\n search on short reads and longer sequences including contigs and\n assemblies, providing a speedup of BLAST ranging up to x20,000."

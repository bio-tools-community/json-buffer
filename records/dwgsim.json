 "description": "short sequencing read simulator\n DWGSIM simulates short sequencing reads from modern sequencing platforms.\n DWGSIM generates base error rates using a parametric model, allowing a more\n realisic error profile. It was originally developed for use in evaluating\n short read aligners."

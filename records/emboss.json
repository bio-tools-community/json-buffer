 "description": "European molecular biology open software suite\n EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially developed for\n the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user community. The software\n automatically copes with data in a variety of formats and even allows\n transparent retrieval of sequence data from the web. Also, as extensive\n libraries are provided with the package, it is a platform to allow other\n scientists to develop and release software in true open source spirit. EMBOSS\n also integrates a range of currently available packages and tools for sequence\n analysis into a seamless whole. EMBOSS breaks the historical trend towards\n commercial software packages."

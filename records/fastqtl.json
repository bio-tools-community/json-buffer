 "description": "Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapper in cis for molecular phenotypes\n The goal of FastQTL is to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)\n which are significantly associated with various molecular phenotypes\n (i.e. expression of known genes, cytosine methylation levels, etc).\n It performs scans for all possible phenotype-variant pairs in cis\n (i.e. variants located within a specific window around a phenotype).\n FastQTL implements a new permutation scheme (Beta approximation) to accurately\n and rapidly correct for multiple-testing at both the genotype and phenotype\n levels."

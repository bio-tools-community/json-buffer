 "description": "tool for assembling Illumina short reads in small regions\n Fml-asm is a command-line tool for assembling Illumina short reads in regions\n from 100bp to 10 million bp in size, based on the fermi-lite library.\n It is largely a light-weight in-memory version of fermikit without\n generating any intermediate files. It inherits the performance, the relatively\n small memory footprint and the features of fermikit. In particular, fermi-lite\n is able to retain heterozygous events and thus can be used to assemble diploid\n regions for the purpose of variant calling."

 "description": "simple index/database for huge amounts of small files\n FFindex is a very simple index/database for huge amounts of small files. The\n files are stored concatenated in one big data file, separated by '\\0'. A\n second file contains a plain text index, giving name, offset and length of\n the small files. The lookup is currently done with a binary search on an\n array made from the index file.\n .\n This package provides the executables."

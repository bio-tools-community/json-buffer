 "description": "Bayesian haplotype-based polymorphism discovery and genotyping\n FreeBayes is a Bayesian genetic variant detector designed to find\n small polymorphisms, specifically SNPs (single-nucleotide\n polymorphisms), indels (insertions and deletions), MNPs\n (multi-nucleotide polymorphisms), and complex events (composite\n insertion and substitution events) smaller than the length of a\n short-read sequencing alignment."

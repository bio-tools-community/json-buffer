 "description": "spliced and SNP-tolerant alignment for mRNA and short reads\n This package contains the programs GMAP and GSNAP as well as\n utilities to manage genome databases in GMAP/GSNAP format.\n GMAP (Genomic Mapping and Alignment Program) is a tool for aligning\n EST, mRNA and cDNA sequences.\n GSNAP (Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program) is a tool for\n aligning single-end and paired-end transcriptome reads.\n Both tools can use a database of\n  * known splice sites and identify novel splice sites.\n  * known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).\n GSNAP can align bisulfite-treated DNA."

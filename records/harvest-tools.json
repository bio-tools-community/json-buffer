 "description": "archiving and postprocessing for reference-compressed genomic multi-alignments\n HarvestTools is a utility for creating and interfacing with Gingr files,\n which are efficient archives that the Harvest Suite uses to store\n reference-compressed multi-alignments, phylogenetic trees, filtered\n variants and annotations. Though designed for use with Parsnp and Gingr,\n HarvestTools can also be used for generic conversion between standard\n bioinformatics file formats."

 "description": "realtime alignment of Illumina reads\n HiLive is a read mapping tool that maps Illumina HiSeq (or comparable)\n reads to a reference genome right in the moment when they are produced.\n This means, read mapping is finished as soon as the sequencer is\n finished generating the data."

 "description": "C library for high-throughput sequencing data formats\n HTSlib is an implementation of a unified C library for accessing common file\n formats, such as SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map), CRAM and VCF (Variant Call\n Format), used for high-throughput sequencing data, and is the core library\n used by samtools and bcftools. HTSlib only depends on zlib. It is known to be\n compatible with gcc, g++ and clang.\n .\n HTSlib implements a generalized BAM (binary SAM) index, with file extension\n \u2018csi\u2019 (coordinate-sorted index). The HTSlib file reader first looks for the\n new index and then for the old if the new index is absent."

 "description": "iterative De Bruijn Graph De Novo short read assembler for transcriptome\n IDBA-Tran is an iterative De Bruijn Graph De Novo short read assembler\n for transcriptome. It is purely de novo assembler based on only RNA\n sequencing reads. IDBA-Tran uses local assembly to reconstructing\n missing k-mers in low-expressed transcripts and then employs progressive\n cutoff on contigs to separate the graph into components. Each component\n corresponds to one gene in most cases and contains not many transcripts.\n A heuristic algorithm based on pair-end reads is then used to find the\n isoforms. "

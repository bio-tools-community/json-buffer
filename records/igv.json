 "description": "Integrative Genomics Viewer\n The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance viewer that\n efficiently handles large heterogeneous data sets, while providing a\n smooth and intuitive user experience at all levels of genome resolution.\n A key characteristic of IGV is its focus on the integrative nature of\n genomic studies, with support for both array-based and next-generation\n sequencing data, and the integration of clinical and phenotypic data.\n Although IGV is often used to view genomic data from public sources,\n its primary emphasis is to support researchers who wish to visualize and\n explore their own data sets or those from colleagues. To that end, IGV\n supports flexible loading of local and remote data sets, and is\n optimized to provide high-performance data visualization and exploration\n on standard desktop systems."

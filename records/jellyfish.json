 "description": "count k-mers in DNA sequences\n JELLYFISH is a tool for fast, memory-efficient counting of k-mers in\n DNA. A k-mer is a substring of length k, and counting the occurrences\n of all such substrings is a central step in many analyses of DNA\n sequence. JELLYFISH can count k-mers using an order of magnitude less\n memory and an order of magnitude faster than other k-mer counting\n packages by using an efficient encoding of a hash table and by\n exploiting the \"compare-and-swap\" CPU instruction to increase\n parallelism.\n .\n JELLYFISH is a command-line program that reads FASTA and multi-FASTA\n files containing DNA sequences. It outputs its k-mer counts in an\n binary format, which can be translated into a human-readable text\n format using the \"jellyfish dump\" command."

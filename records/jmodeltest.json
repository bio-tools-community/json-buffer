 "description": "HPC selection of models of nucleotide substitution\n jModelTest is a tool to carry out statistical selection of best-fit\n models of nucleotide substitution. It implements five different model\n selection strategies: hierarchical and dynamical likelihood ratio tests\n (hLRT and dLRT), Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC),\n and a decision theory method (DT). It also provides estimates of model\n selection uncertainty, parameter importances and model-averaged\n parameter estimates, including model-averaged tree topologies.\n jModelTest 2 includes High Performance Computing (HPC) capabilities and\n additional features like new strategies for tree optimization, model-\n averaged phylogenetic trees (both topology and branch length), heuristic\n filtering and automatic logging of user activity."

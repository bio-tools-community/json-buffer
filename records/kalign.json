 "description": "Global and progressive multiple sequence alignment\n Kalign is a command line tool to perform multiple alignment of\n biological sequences. It employs the Muth-Manber string-matching\n algorithm, to improve both the accuracy and speed of the alignment.\n It uses global, progressive alignment approach, enriched by employing\n an approximate string-matching algorithm to calculate sequence\n distances and by incorporating local matches into the otherwise global\n alignment."

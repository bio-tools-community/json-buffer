 "description": "Evaluate and visualize protein interatomic packing\n king-probe is a program that allows one to evaluate atomic packing, either\n within or between molecules. It generates \"contact dots\" where\n atoms are in close contact.\n .\n The program king-probe generates \"contact dots\" at points on the van der\n Waals surface of atoms which are in close proximity to other atoms; reading\n atomic coordinates in protein databank (PDB) format files and writing\n color-coded dot lists (spikes where atoms clash) for inclusion in a\n kinemage."

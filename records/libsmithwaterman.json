 "description": "determine similar regions between two strings or genomic sequences (lib)\n The Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that is,\n for determining similar regions between two strings or nucleotide or\n protein sequences. Instead of looking at the total sequence, the\n Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and\n optimizes the similarity measure.\n .\n This package contains the dynamic library."

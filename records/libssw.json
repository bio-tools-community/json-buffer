 "description": "fast SIMD parallelized implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm\n SSW is a fast implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm, which uses the\n Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) instructions to parallelize the\n algorithm at the instruction level. SSW library provides an API that can be\n flexibly used by programs written in C, C++ and other languages. The library\n can do protein and genome alignment directly.\n Current version of this implementation is ~50 times faster than an ordinary\n Smith-Waterman. It can return the Smith-Waterman score, alignment location\n and traceback path (cigar) of the optimal alignment accurately; and return\n the sub-optimal alignment score and location heuristically."

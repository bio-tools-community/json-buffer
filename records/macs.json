 "description": "Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq on short reads sequencers\n MACS empirically models the length of the sequenced ChIP fragments, which \n tends to be shorter than sonication or library construction size estimates, \n and uses it to improve the spatial resolution of predicted binding sites. \n MACS also uses a dynamic Poisson distribution to effectively capture local \n biases in the genome sequence, allowing for more sensitive and robust \n prediction. MACS compares favorably to existing ChIP-Seq peak-finding \n algorithms, is publicly available open source, and can be used for ChIP-Seq \n with or without control samples."

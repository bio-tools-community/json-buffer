 "description": "MEGAN alignment tool\n MALT, an acronym for MEGAN alignment tool, is a sequence alignment and\n analysis tool designed for processing high-throughput sequencing data,\n especially in the context of metagenomics. It is an extension of MEGAN6,\n the MEGenome Analyzer and is designed to provide the input for MEGAN6,\n but can also be used independently of MEGAN6.\n .\n The core of the program is a sequence alignment engine that aligns DNA\n or protein sequences to a DNA or protein reference database in either\n BLASTN (DNA queries and DNA references), BLASTX (DNA queries and protein\n references) or BLASTP (protein queries and protein references) mode. The\n engine uses a banded-alignment algorithm with ane gap scores and BLOSUM\n substitution matrices (in the case of protein alignments). The program\n can compute both local alignments (Smith-Waterman) or semi-global\n alignments (in which reads are aligned end-to-end into reference\n sequences), the latter being more appropriate for aligning metagenomic\n reads to references."

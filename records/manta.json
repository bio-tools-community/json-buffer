 "description": "structural variant and indel caller for mapped sequencing data\n Manta calls structural variants (SVs) and indels from mapped paired-end\n sequencing reads. It is optimized for analysis of germline variation in\n small sets of individuals and somatic variation in tumor/normal sample\n pairs. Manta discovers, assembles and scores large-scale SVs, medium-\n sized indels and large insertions within a single efficient workflow.\n The method is designed for rapid analysis on standard compute hardware:\n NA12878 at 50x genomic coverage is analyzed in less than 20 minutes on a\n 20 core server, and most WGS tumor/normal analyses can be completed\n within 2 hours. Manta combines paired and split-read evidence during SV\n discovery and scoring to improve accuracy, but does not require split-\n reads or successful breakpoint assemblies to report a variant in cases\n where there is strong evidence otherwise. It provides scoring models for\n germline variants in small sets of diploid samples and somatic variants\n in matched tumor/normal sample pairs. There is experimental support for\n analysis of unmatched tumor samples as well. Manta accepts input read\n mappings from BAM or CRAM files and reports all SV and indel inferences\n in VCF 4.1 format."

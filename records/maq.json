 "description": "maps short fixed-length polymorphic DNA sequence reads to reference sequences\n Maq (short for Mapping and Assembly with Quality) builds mapping assemblies\n from short reads generated by the next-generation sequencing machines. It was\n particularly designed for Illumina-Solexa 1G Genetic Analyzer, and has a\n preliminary functionality to handle ABI SOLiD data. Maq is previously known as\n mapass2.\n .\n Developmemt of Maq stopped in 2008. Its successors are BWA and SAMtools."

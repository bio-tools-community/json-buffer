 "description": "Bayesian Inference of Phylogeny\n Bayesian inference of phylogeny is based upon a quantity called the posterior\n probability distribution of trees, which is the probability of a tree \n conditioned on the observations. The conditioning is accomplished using \n Bayes's theorem. The posterior probability distribution of trees is \n impossible to calculate analytically; instead, MrBayes uses a simulation \n technique called Markov chain Monte Carlo (or MCMC) to approximate the \n posterior probabilities of trees."

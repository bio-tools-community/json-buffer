 "description": "bayesian estimation of gene trees taking the species tree into account\n PrIME (Probabilistic Integrated Models of Evolution) is a package\n supporting inference of evolutionary parameters in a Bayesian framework\n using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. A distinguishing feature of\n PrIME is that the species tree is taken into account when analyzing gene\n trees.\n .\n The input data to PrIME is a multiple sequence alignment in FASTA format\n and the output data contains trees in Newick format."

 "description": "multiple genome alignment algorithms\n The mauveAligner and progressiveMauve alignment algorithms have been\n implemented as command-line programs included with the downloadable Mauve\n software.  When run from the command-line, these programs provide options\n not yet available in the graphical interface.\n .\n Mauve is a system for efficiently constructing multiple genome alignments\n in the presence of large-scale evolutionary events such as rearrangement\n and inversion. Multiple genome alignment provides a basis for research\n into comparative genomics and the study of evolutionary dynamics.  Aligning\n whole genomes is a fundamentally different problem than aligning short\n sequences.\n .\n Mauve has been developed with the idea that a multiple genome aligner\n should require only modest computational resources. It employs algorithmic\n techniques that scale well in the amount of sequence being aligned. For\n example, a pair of Y. pestis genomes can be aligned in under a minute,\n while a group of 9 divergent Enterobacterial genomes can be aligned in\n a few hours.\n .\n Mauve computes and interactively visualizes genome sequence comparisons.\n Using FastA or GenBank sequence data, Mauve constructs multiple genome\n alignments that identify large-scale rearrangement, gene gain, gene loss,\n indels, and nucleotide substutition.\n .\n Mauve is developed at the University of Wisconsin."

 "description": "RNA-Seq De novo Assembly\n Trinity represents a novel method for the efficient and robust de novo\n reconstruction of transcriptomes from RNA-seq data. Trinity combines three\n independent software modules: Inchworm, Chrysalis, and Butterfly, applied\n sequentially to process large volumes of RNA-seq reads. Trinity partitions\n the sequence data into many individual de Bruijn graphs, each representing the\n transcriptional complexity at a given gene or locus, and then processes\n each graph independently to extract full-length splicing isoforms and to tease\n apart transcripts derived from paralogous genes."
